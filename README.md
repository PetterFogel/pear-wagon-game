**Pear Wagon - A P5JS School-project**  
**This is a game where you are supposed to catch pears**

*documents-folder contains:*  
    *relevant documents such as presentation and UML-diagram*  
    *-figma-sketches*  
    *-prototype*  
    *-screens*  

We tried the game with noCursor() on playscreen, but the controls got bad when the cursor goes out of screen.

**To get ready clone down and type:**  
**"npm i"**  
**"npm start"**  
  
**Or just test it out on Netlify!**
